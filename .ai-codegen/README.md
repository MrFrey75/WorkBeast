# AI Code Generation Guidelines for WorkBeast

This folder contains rules, prompt templates and examples intended for AI tools and human contributors who generate code for the WorkBeast repository.

Purpose
- Provide consistent conventions and guardrails for automated code generation.
- Reduce churn by requiring runnable artifacts, tests, and repository-compliant changes.

Contents
- `RULES.md` — mandatory rules and constraints for generated code.
- `TEMPLATES.md` — prompt templates to produce consistent results.
- `EXAMPLES.md` — sample prompts and expected outputs.

Usage
- Read `RULES.md` before generating code.
- Use `TEMPLATES.md` to craft prompts for features, bug fixes, and tests.
- Add new examples to `EXAMPLES.md` as patterns emerge.

If you want me to update the root `README.md` with a link to this folder, say so and I'll add it.
